# {Software Requirement}
- a property that must be exhibited by something in order to solve some problem in the real world
**Sw Requirements** knowledge area (KA): _elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation_ of software requirements + _management_ of requirements - during the whole life cycle of the software product
- projects are {critically vulnerable} when the requirements- related activities are poorly performed
- express the {needs and constraints} placed on a software product that contribute to the solution of some real-world problem
- what the system should do and define constraints on its operation and implementation
**Functional vs non-functional requirements**
- func req: 
	- what the system does  
	- describe ways a product must behave; include all the features of your future project and the ways users engage with it
	- includes Use cases, User stories, Functional decomposition (diagrams)
- non-func req (/ quality attributes): 
	- how the system works  
	- describe general software characteristics
	- usability, reliability, performance etc 
	- to identify them, you need to analyze the product's performance  
**Requirements specification** is the process of formally documenting the {user and system requirements} and creating a {sw requirements document}.   
**sw requirements document**
- an agreed statement of the system requirements
- organized so that both system customers and software developers can use it
Business, organizational, and technical changes inevitably lead to changes to the {requirements} for a sw system. **Requirements {management}** is the process of {managing} and controlling these changes
